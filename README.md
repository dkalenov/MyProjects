| 1 | [The Simpsons Characters Classification](https://github.com/dkalenov/The-Simpsons-characters-Classification-DL) | Trained a Convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify characters from the animated series "The Simpsons". Achieved a required metric value of 0.83 on the test dataset. Explored model training time, implemented image classification function, and analyzed classification errors. Achieved an excellent metric value of over 0.95 | Data preprocessing Data augmentation Python Pandas PIL Matplotlib Scikit-learn PyTorch |
| 2 | [Gym Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/dkalenov/Gym-Customer-Churn-Prediction) | Developed models to predict customer churn in a gym, based on in-depth analysis of customer churn data and training models using Scikit-learn. Achieved an accuracy rate of over 90% on test data | Data preprocessing Exploratory Data Analysis Python Pandas Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit-learn  |
| 3 | [Bicycle Sharing Prediction Models](https://github.com/dkalenov/Bicycle-Sharing-Prediction-Models) | Developed models to predict daily demand for a bicycle sharing service in South Korea. Conducted data processing, prepared data for model building, and conducted exploratory data analysis. Achieved an accuracy rate of 90% using Scikit-learn, HyperOpt, and implementing pipelines for workflow automation | Data preprocessing Exploratory Data Analysis Python Pandas Matplotlib Scikit-learn HyperOpt |
| 4 | [TMDB Movie Data Analysis](https://github.com/dkalenov/TMDB-Movie-Data-Analysis) | Conducted data analysis on TMDB movie data, loaded data into databases, and tested hypotheses related to the number of films released per year and their profitability based on genre and remakes. Utilized SQL queries and Python for data analysis | Data analysis Python Pandas Matplotlib SQL SQLite |
| 5 | [Weatheucity](https://github.com/dkalenov/weather-bot) | Developed a telegram weather bot that displays weather information of a given city from the site https://openweathermap.org/. The bot provides weather forecasts for the current moment, the next 24 hours, and the next 5 days. Used Python, requests, datetime, aiogram, OpenWeatherMap API, and Telegram Bot API | Telegram Bot API Python Requests Datetime Aiogram OpenWeatherMap API |
